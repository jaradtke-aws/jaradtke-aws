# Best Practices (Universal Recommendations)
* Do NOT use the "Root Account" for anything other than creating new IAM accounts.
* Use MFA.  Always. (where possible)
* Use Short-term credentials (if/when you are needing programmatic access).
* Cloud9 is a great IDE which is integrated to AWS Services and does not require management of AWS access keys.
* Create and use a ["tagging strategy"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) of some sort.
* Check out [AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/) - I am not saying everyone should use IAM Identity Center - but.. you **should** at least look it.
